# Simple livereload example

I wanted to tinker with SVGs and wanted a tight iteration loop, so I put this together based on some "research"...  I mean searching blog posts and Stack Overflow.

## Usage

Install the required libraries and start the server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then visit http://localhost:4000 to see index.html.  Make changes to index.html, and you should see the changes in the browser quickly without having to refresh.
